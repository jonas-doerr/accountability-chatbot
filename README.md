# Accountability Chatbot
I'm working on my NLP skills and think this will be a useful project for myself and some friends I know.

## To-do
- Backend setup
    - Choose where to store data
    - User table
    - Goal/task table
- Basic chat interface
    - command line interface
- Goal creation
- Task prioritization
- Streak tracker and small rewards
- Notifications (email or push)
- Motivation/positive feedback (sentiment analysis)
- Testing and polishing

Set up some files and basic structures. Need to study SQL before I can proceed much more.

Got busy and demotivated and took many days off. Back at it now. Updated the chatbot a bit and made it usable. It can take someone's name and create a user. That user builds up a streak every time they check in by using the bot.
